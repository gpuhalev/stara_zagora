          <p><strong>Dear friends of athletics,</strong></p>
          <p>The European Athletics Team Championships 2nd League will be held on 20-21 June 2015 in the city of Stara Zagora, Bulgaria. Eight top level teams - Croatia, Cyprus, Denmark, Hungary, Iceland, Serbia,Slovenia and Bulgaria are going to struggle for the first two places that will promote them to the First league in 2017.</p>
          <p>The team events in athletics have a special place in the hearts of athletic lovers and the European Team Championships are the largest event in the world of its kind. Over 45 teams with more than 2000 athletes will take part in the four leagues.</p>
          <p>For Bulgaria it is a unique competition, as we are going to witness 40 performances of the 50 athletes who are the best in their disciplines.</p>
          <p>I&#96;m glad that this competition is hosted by Stara Zagora - the city with the greatest and competent athletics audience. The recently renovated &quot;Beroe&quot; stadium, the new track and wonderful facilities are giving additional motivation to the athletes to strive to achieve their best results.</p>
          <p>The world record of 12.21 in 100m Hurdles was set by the brilliant Yordanka Donkova back in 1998 on this very stadium, which makes it emblematic for the Bulgarian and World athletics.</p>
          <p>I hope we are going to see over the two competition days European and World class results that will remain in the statistics for long years, like the record of Yordanka Donkova which is on the top of the all times best lists for 26 years already. </p>
          <p>Good luck to all participants!</p>

          <p><strong>Dear fellow citizens and guests of Stara Zagora,</strong></p>
          <p>I am truly glad that our city's consistent efforts and the excellent conditions we have created for staging athletics events of a highest level have been appreciated once again. I would like to note that it was the result of the united and focused efforts of the Municipality, the Athletics Club &quot;Beroe&quot;, Bulgarian Athletic Federation and Bulgarian Ministry of Youth and Sports.</p>
          <p>I am pleased that after we have successfully hosted the 66th Balkan Athletics Championships in 2013 and have resumed the prestigious International Meeting &quot;Samarsko Zname&quot; in 2014 on the stadium under the beautiful park &quot;Ayazmoto&quot;, quite logically in 2015 Stara Zagora is again hosting an important international event &#45; the European Athletics Team Championships 2nd League. </p>
          <p>I would like to thank the members of the Organising Committee and Bulgarian Athletic Federation for having placed a successful bid, approved by European Athletics. I wish you further success in strength, height, speed and beauty in the name of sport which unites people all around the world and makes them better. </p>
          <p>I am happy to welcome in our lovely city all the participants, coaches, officials and guests of Stara Zagora! I believe that all the athletes will succeed in showing their abilities and accomplishing their potential in the best way. I wish you all unforgettable moments and positive emotions, which would make you come back in our hospitable city!</p>
          <p>Good Luck!</p>
